<div class="container pt-4">
    <h1 style="color:#D9B6E0">How</h1>
    <p>We have people register into our database with a valid identification, that will then allow them to sign-up/view any other platforms as long as their information coincides with rules of the platform.</p>

    <h1 style="color:#D9B6E0">Why</h1>
    <p>Many online users are frustrated with the lack of accountability and online safety on multiple platforms. Social Universe allows for a centralized product that can be used to register for any platforms, which then creates user accountability and online safety. If people are blacklisted from platforms, they won't be allowed to repeat the cycle of animosity online. Underage users will also be disallowed from viewing content that's not appropriate. People will be allowed to continue using the freedom of the internet but now there's online accountability and safety.</p>
