A repository for the 2023 T9Hacks Hackathon project SocialUniverse

## Front-End
Our front-end work includes a logo, a design schema, and various prototypes of the main website. We have two Figma prototypes (one mobile, one desktop), and a Django prototype.

## Back-End
Our back-end work includes a database design, specifically a core database plus query restrictions and view tables documented as a PDF and a PNG with the entity-relationship diagram of the core database.
