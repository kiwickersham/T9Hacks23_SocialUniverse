# T9Hacks23_SocialUniverse
A repository for the 2023 T9Hacks Hackathon project SocialUniverse

## Front-End
Our front-end work includes a logo, a design schema, and various prototypes of the main website. We have two Figma prototypes (one mobile, one desktop), and a Django prototype you can run on your machine once cloned.

__Desktop Figma Prototype__: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/KySqXzLsiS38Spjk5eqGqP/T9-Hacks-Social-Universe-Prototype?page-id=530%3A129&node-id=536%3A31&viewport=-141%2C95%2C0.26&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=536%3A31&show-proto-sidebar=1)

__Mobile Figma Prototype__: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/KySqXzLsiS38Spjk5eqGqP/T9-Hacks-Social-Universe-Prototype?page-id=530%3A129&node-id=580%3A561&viewport=2%2C127%2C0.19&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=580%3A595&show-proto-sidebar=1)

## Back-End
Our back-end work includes a database design, specifically a core database plus query restrictions and view tables documented as a PDF and a PNG with the entity-relationship diagram of the core database.

## Additional Work
In considering future development of the SocialUniverse project, we put together a guide for future research: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cM4_KoFPcsHaw3ALdh0vT_XDyA7kj8An-B8IIPQlAm8/edit?usp=sharing)
